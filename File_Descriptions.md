## C++ Final Project - Starter File Descriptions

We are giving you a set of starter files to help get you started.  

To get the files into your JuypterLab environment:  

*   Clone the `xyz`Â repository to your computer by accessing the GIT repository.

The files included are described as follows:  

#### `main.cpp`

*   You will enter your code here
*   Contains the `read_image` and `write_image` functions
*   Please answer the questions located in the comments at the top of this file prior to submission

####  `sample.bmp`

*   A sample BMP image file that you can use to test your code

####   `sample_images` (folder)

*   A folder that contains sample images from the output of each of the 10 processes
*   Note that a second copy of the `sample.bmp` file is included here in case you accidentally modify the one in the main directory

## Building your application 
To compile your code and create an executable, you can use the following command:  

		g++ -std=c++11 -o main main.cpp

To run your executable, you can use the following command:  

		./main

To compile your code and run your executable in a single line, you can use the following command:  

		g++ -std=c++11 -o main main.cpp && ./main

### Command line tip:  

*   You can use the up (and down) arrow key on your keyboard to cycle through previous commands quickly. 
*   After you've entered your compile command and run command once, you can always pull those commands back up without typing them again by pressing the up arrow key until you've reached the desired previous command and then pressing enter to execute it.
